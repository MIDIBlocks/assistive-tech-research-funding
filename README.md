> **Assistive Technology is the surest path towards developing real-life superpowers.**

There is a crazy amount of funding opportunities in tech, from grants and residencies to speaking opportunities and angel investments, incubators, and accelerators. Accessing these funds can be challenging however, especially if you're not even aware of what's available.

This repository is here to:

- **Help encourage continued research into Assistive Technologies.** Often times projects stop at the end of an experiment, internship, or when funding runs out despite the obvious impact projects may have on millions of people
- **Help you plan and structure your project so that it gets funded.** In the startup world there are battle tested strategies to maximize the chances of successful funding, but there isn't a lot of info for designing fundable research projects
- **Help reduce Impostor Syndrome and emphasize the potential impact of funded Assistive Tech.** Almost no one is successful overnight and because Assistive Tech does not usually address a mainstream demographic, it is important to focus on the potential impact and strategize for a long term game
